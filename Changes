Revision history for Perl extension FormMagick.

0.55
----

MAJOR CHANGES, WARNING WARNING AWOOGA AWOOGA.  THIS RELEASE BREAKS
BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY LOTS.

Added HTML and SUBROUTINE elements to allow arbitrary stuff in your
forms.

Added LEXICON element so that l10n now happens right in your XML.
Removed all Locale::Maketext stuff.

OPTIONS which are hashes (either from a subroutine or static) now sort
by value rather than key.

CHECKBOX values now default to "1" if you don't set them, and retain
their state when navigating back and forth.

Added validation routine(s):
    Network         mac_address()

Improved taint-friendliness.

0.50
----

Various code cleanups.

Added experimental file upload support.

Changed email() validation routine to email_simple()

OO interface to previousbutton() and friends

More taint-friendly

Starting to deprecate Locale::Maketext in favour of XML-based lexicons

0.49
----

New numbering scheme (CPAN-friendly).

Lots of internal fixes, shouldn't be visible to users.

Lots of stuff has been moved out to sub-modules such as
CGI::FormMagick::Setup etc.  Most of this should be irrelevant and
invisible to users.

One visible bugfix: there were problems with i18n and the "Next" button
because we were looking for the literal string "Next".  This has been
fixed.

0.4.1
-----
Fixed a small bug which caused SELECT MULTIPLE fields with no SIZE to
have their size default to only showing one item.

0.4.0
-----
Error messages now appear near the fields to which they apply, and can
be prettified using the "error" class in a cascading style sheet.

A new parameter to the new() method, SESSIONDIR, allows the user to
specify where they want their session-handling tokens to be put.

The parameters PREVIOUSBUTTON, RESETBUTTON and STARTOVERLINK, when given
to new(), allow you to switch off these buttons/links.  They default to
being on.

New validation routines now working:
	password()
	credit_card_number()
	credit_card_expiry()

Validation module no longer requires Business::CreditCard

Major reworking and bug-fixing of the flow between pages when clicking
Next/Previous/etc, including passing round a stack of all previous pages
visited.

Fixes to validation, including stuff that allows you to validate stuff
by hand if you want.

SELECT MULTIPLE is now supported.

SIZE is now supported for TEXT and SELECT form elements.

0.3.1
-----
Added stub L10N perl modules for every language in iso639.  This means
that add_lexicon() now works for *any* real language.

Added some tools to assist developers in generating L10N translations.

A couple of very small bugfixes.

0.3.0
-----
Renamed to CGI::FormMagick

Changes to DTD:
Optional CHECKED attribute on FIELD

Validation changes:
user-supplied routines now work
much improved docco

Other changes:
You can now use TYPE => "STRING" as well as "FILE"
RADIO buttons now implemented
CHECKBOX now implemented

0.2.9
-----
Made FormMagick CPAN-friendly.

Changes to DTD:
NAME attriute on PAGE element is now required
optional DESCRIPTION attribute for PAGE and FIELD elements

Validation changes:
domain_name routine now works

L10N changes:
You can now add items to the lexicon with the add_lexicon method

Debugging:
Adding DEBUG => 1 to your new() call will turn debugging on
You can use debug messages yourself with $fm->debug($message)

Look and feel:
You can now put DESCRIPTION attributes on your pages and/or fields, and
   they'll show up nicely output in the HTML.
Most parts of the form now have CSS "label" attriutes so you can
   change the look and feel of your FormMagick apps

Other functionality changes:
Page pre/post events now work
Form post events now work
You can use form post events to "branch" to a page other than the
   next one in line by setting $cgi's "wherenext" param
when calling the new() method, TYPE now defaults to "file" and SOURCE
   to the same filename as your script but with a .xml extension

Examples:
A worked example of collecting email retrieval options for the e-smith
server and gateway system is included in examples/e-smith/
