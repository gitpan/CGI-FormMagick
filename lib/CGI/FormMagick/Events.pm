=head1 NAME

CGI::FormMagick::Events -- pre/post form/page event handlers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use CGI::FormMagick;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 $fm->form_pre_event()

performs the PRE-EVENT (if any) for the form.  Usually used to do
setup for the application.

this is the routine where we call some routine that will
give us default data for the form, or otherwise
do things that need doing before the form is submitted.

=for testing
TODO: {
    local $TODO = "Write tests for Event.pm!";
    ok(0, "nothing here yet");
}

sub form_pre_event {

    $self->debug_msg("This is the form pre event");
    $self->debug_msg("This is the form pre event");

    # find out what the form pre_event action is. 
    my $pre_form_routine = $self->{xml}->{'PRE-EVENT'} || return;

    $self->do_external_routine($pre_form_routine);
}

=pod

=head2 $fm->form_post_event()

performs validation and runs the POST-EVENT (if any) otherwise just
prints out the data that the user input

Note: we need to validate EVERY ONE of the form inputs to make
sure malicious attacks don't happen.   See also "SECURITY 
CONSIDERATIONS" in the perldoc for how to get around this :-/
